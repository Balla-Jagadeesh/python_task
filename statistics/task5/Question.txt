Q-5. A certain city has two taxi companies: Company A has 80% of the taxis and
Company B has 20% of the taxis. Company A's taxis have a 95% success rate for picking
up passengers on time, while Company B's taxis have a 90% success rate. If a randomly
selected taxi is late, what is the probability that it belongs to Company A?


To calculate the probability that a randomly selected late taxi belongs to Company A, we can use Bayes' theorem.

Let's define the following probabilities:
P(A) = Probability of selecting a taxi from Company A = 0.8
P(B) = Probability of selecting a taxi from Company B = 0.2
P(L|A) = Probability that a taxi from Company A is late = 1 - 0.95 = 0.05 (since success rate is 95%)
P(L|B) = Probability that a taxi from Company B is late = 1 - 0.90 = 0.10 (since success rate is 90%)

We want to calculate P(A|L), which is the probability that a late taxi belongs to Company A.

According to Bayes' theorem:

P(A|L) = (P(L|A) * P(A)) / (P(L|A) * P(A) + P(L|B) * P(B))

Let's plug in the values:

P(A|L) = (0.05 * 0.8) / (0.05 * 0.8 + 0.10 * 0.2)

Simplifying the equation:

P(A|L) = 0.04 / (0.04 + 0.02)

P(A|L) = 0.04 / 0.06

P(A|L) = 0.6667

Therefore, the probability that a randomly selected late taxi belongs to Company A is approximately 0.6667 or 66.67%.
